GAS Companion provides a few Console Commands to help in debugging you can access via the built-in debug console. This is done via a [Cheat Manager](https://benui.ca/unreal/cheatmanager/) class.

The `GSCPlayerController` class is pre-configured with `GSCCheatManager` and provides the following commands.

### GSC_AbilityQueueDebug

This command shows / hides the [Ability Queue Debug Widget](/ability-queue-system#debug-widget)

Here is a brief description of the debug widget:

- `Ability Queue Enabled` whether the ability queue is enabled for the player character
- `Ability Queue Opened` whether the ability queue is currently opened via the ability or anim montages. Abilities can be queued only within this window.
- `Allow All Abilities` the queue system requires a list of abilities to be allowed for activation. This boolean can be turned on in abilities or within anim montages (via notify state) state which will consider *all* abilities for activation.
- `Current Queued Ability` is updated when an ability attempts to activate within the ability queue opened window and fail to do so, setting it up for activation when the current ability ends.
- `Ability Queue Opened From Montages` at the bottom right displays a list of anim montages from which the ability queue was opened via notify state (`AbilityQueueWindow`)

### GSC_OpenComboDebug

This command shows / hides the [Combo Debug Widget](/melee-ability/#debug-combo-widget)

Here is a brief description of the debug widget:

- `Combo Window Opened` whether the combo window is currently enabled for the player character (done with anim montages notifiers)
- `Should Trigger Combo` indicates the player has queued an input for activation of the next combo montage
- `Request Trigger Combo` turned on by the Trigger Combo notifier, the exact time within the Combo Window to activate the next combo montage if the player registered an input within the combo window
- `Next Combo Activate` is updated when the following combo montage has been activated, used when closing the combo window to know if combo needs to be reset
- `Combo Index` the current combo index, ranging from 0 to the size of the Montages list in the Combo Ability

### GSC_ShowDebugAbilitySystem

Shortcut command to `showdebug abilitysystem`.

### GSC_AbilitySystemNextCategory
